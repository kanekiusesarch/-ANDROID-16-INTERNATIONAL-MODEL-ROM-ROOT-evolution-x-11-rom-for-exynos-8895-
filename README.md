BUGS/HOW TO FIX 
brightness|the fix is a kernel su module included in the release
wifi| this is just a fix that ya need to flash in twrp 
camera|on some devices if it doesnt work try to reflash it. if that doesnt work i will release a breeze os rom too and i found out if you install that rom first then boot into set up them proceed to format it in twrp (ONLY FORMAT IT NOTHIN ELSE) then proceed to flash the evo x rom it might be fixed it did on my galaxy s8

|INSTALLATION|
boot to twrp 
format your data 
then proceed to advanced wip and wipe the dalvik cache data system and vendor partitions
then reboot to twrp flash the repartitioner.zip
flash the cleaner.zip
then flash the evolution x rom
then let it install and boot if it doesnt boot go to twrp then change the /data partition to f2fs
reboot to the os and boom you just installed android 16 to a damn 7 to 8 year phone!

HOW TO INSTALL THE FIXES 
for the brightness fix (MANDATORY IF YA WANT TO SEE SMTH ON THE SCREEN)
install the kernel su manager apk included (the manager version is 0.7.5) then flahs the brightness module reboot and boom 
and if the wifi doesnt work ust flash the wifi fix in twrp after ya installed the rom

THE ROM COMES WITH A PREROOTED KERNEL 
(FURINA 4.4)
