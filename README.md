# -ANDROID-16-INTERNATIONAL-MODEL-ROM-ROOT-evolution-x-11-rom-for-exynos-8895-
a kernel rooted + android 16 rom for samsung phones such as the s8 s8+ note 8 and other exynos 8895 devices I AM NOT RESPOSNSIBLE FOR BRICKED PHONES GUNS NUKES AND THE LIGHT YAGAMI GETTING A DEATH NOTE (refrence)
heyo its me kaneki again and today il be giving ya a guide abt how to get this amazing rom for 8895 phones 
btw this is NOT MY ROM the gsi  is made by Doze-Off. the base comes from @thewinner02 (telegram) and the brightness fix is made by @JIeMoHuCHuKeT (telegram)

BUGS/HOW TO FIX 
brightness|the fix is a kernel su module included in the release
wifi| this is just a fix that ya need to flash in twrp 
camera|on some devices if it doesnt work try to reflash it. if that doesnt work i will release a breeze os rom too and i found out if you install that rom first then boot into set up them proceed to format it in twrp (ONLY FORMAT IT NOTHIN ELSE) then proceed to flash the evo x rom it might be fixed it did on my galaxy s8

|NONFIXABLEBUGS|
there are some weird bugs that evne i can manage to fix.
soft reboots everytime ya uninstall a app and sometimes flickers when you boot it up and if someway it keeps flcikering out of nowhere simply disable the
settings for adaptive brightness.

|INSTALLATION|
boot to twrp 
format your data 
then proceed to advanced wip and wipe the dalvik cache data system and vendor partitions
then reboot to twrp flash the repartitioner.zip
flash the cleaner.zip
then flash the evolution x rom
then let it install and boot if it doesnt boot go to twrp then change the /data partition to f2fs
reboot to the os and boom you just installed android 16 to a damn 7 to 8 year phone!

HOW TO INSTALL THE FIXES 
for the brightness fix (MANDATORY IF YA WANT TO SEE SMTH ON THE SCREEN)
install the kernel su manager apk included (the manager version is 0.7.5) then flahs the brightness module reboot and boom 
and if the wifi doesnt work ust flash the wifi fix in twrp after ya installed the rom

THE ROM COMES WITH A PREROOTED KERNEL 
(FURINA 4.4)
ENJOY THE ROM 
i released this rom here cuz im anoyed myself by ppl making roms yet never really publicy releasing it or does it but its super duper hard to find them
and there are amazing devs making roms  yet not many use them cuz ppl cant find them easy on the clearnet and its mostly in some kind of telegram group.

|MY EXPERINCE| 
evo x is a really customizable rom and just gives you a super premium like excperince compared to other custom roms.
also its kinda a all in one rom you get root and evo x's settings and quirks like being able to change the boot anim the font the system theme the icons fully navbar and having built in play intergity fixes.
ive been using it for abt 4 weeks on my s8 and using benchmarking software like antutu give the score of 398732 and the avg for the s8 is 372105. this shows it adds more then 20k more points 26.627 to be exact also the battery life is avg and smoothness is like your using one ui 7 on a galaxy s25 like its built for it.
BUT one drawback is that if ya run games like roblox pokemon go fnaf or play 2k to 4k vids in yt it does like to heat up. other having root is always nice to have and its kernelsu and kernelsu vs magisk there are diffrences like magisk is systemless root but kernelsu might be a bit new it does offer more intergration cuz its kernel level root and lightweight. id give it a 8/10 cuz its android 16 on a 7 year old device that runs super smooth on such a old device plus other android 16 roms ive tested/used(coming soon)
where a bit more unstable compared to this beast of a rom. 
bye bye have fun
